import { Card, CardGrid, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="caution" title="This plugin is currently in BETA">
We are actively working on improving the plugin and adding new features. If you have any feedback or feature requests, please let us know.

## Concepts

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Create design tokens from Figma variable">
    No need for extra value management. Create W3C-compliant design tokens from Figma variables.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="One-way Synchronize only">
    This plugin supported one-way data propagation from Figma to the codebase. We intentionally do not support the reverse direction to keep the flow simple.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
